# Github Avatar Downloader

## Problem Statement

Given a Github repository name and owner, download all the contributors' profile images and save them to a subdirectory, `avatars/`.

## Expected Usage

This program should be run from the the command line using the following:

`node download_avatars.js <repoOwner> <repoName>`

as well you will need to include your own file `secrets.js` which takes a
gitHub_token.
